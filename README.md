# PAWFIVE
## Summary
PAWFIVE is a specialized training app for **dogs**, supported by their owners, to track their skill progressions and sessions, while aided by *voice recognition* features. 

## Mission
 The goal of this project is to enhance the quality relationships of all pack members, humans and dogs alike, through enjoyment of light-hearted discipline. 

## Platform
 PAWFIVE is mobile-first designed, currently for the iOS devices. It may work on other mobile devices, though sub-optimally.

## How to use
1. After forking, install dependancies using **npm install**
```
npm install
```
2. Make your current directory as the express-back-end from the root folder, and run it in a terminal.
```
cd express-back-end

npm start
```
3. Switch to the react-front-end directory, from its root folder, and run that in a **separate** terminal.
```
cd react-front-end

npm start
```
4. Make an account with wit.ai and follow their instructions on how to train your ai to recognize commands. Be sure to customize your info in your ENV file.

5. Use the db folder to help you generate your own dogs, users, and tutorials. We used pswl hosted on Heroku.

Enjoy!
